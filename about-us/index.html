          <h4>
            Over the course of human history, science has developed from our
            early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring
            everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of
            life itself. The aim of our museum is to create a space where
            everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps
            even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the
            world around us. We believe science should not be confined to the
            textbook, but brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have
            over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science
            to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact
            with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the
            dinosaur exhibits - they only come to life at night when everyone's
            gone home).

          <h2>For kids</h2>
          <p>
            You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why
            not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our
            exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make
            sure you come ready to learn and explore. We also have the Young
            Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and
            13:00 where you'll get to explore and experiment with our team of
            experts. During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs
            where you can join other children your age to go on a journey of
            discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out
            more about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.

          <h2>For teachers</h2>
          <p>
            As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create
            places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your
            students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning
            laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite
            and inspire them. Please get in touch with us here to find out more
            about our facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students
            through for a visit.

          <h2>Researchers</h2>
          <p>
            Are you looking to get involved with our team of researchers and
            academics? Our museum offers various ways for you to use our
            resources and contribute towards them. We have online records,
            laboratory space, and a working relationship with a number of
            universities around the country.
